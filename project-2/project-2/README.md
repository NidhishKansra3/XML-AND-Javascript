* My data consists of id, Country, Currency name and Currency Code. I created a controller which has getById and getAll functions. There are two buttons reset and submit. 
When the user clicks on apply button the data in the form is fetched and passed to the getAll function. The getAll function then fetches the data and applies the filters that were passed to it. The data returned by getAll function is then used to render the table. *
